#Laravel api starter

Every (almost) Laravel project requires some form of authentication with which users can create their account (register) and then log in using their credentials. In this project, I present an API implementation of commonly used authentication endpoints using test-driven development (TDD). Anyone who is new to TDD with Laravel can benefit from this.
